Been working on a little porject for a bit. Just finsihed the first revision of it today. 
It's a wordguess game, basically a hangman clone, that I made with what I learned in java.
It's up on my github if you want to check out the source or download the JAR file and give it a go.
Here is the link: [https://github.com/oakeef/Word-Guess-Game](https://github.com/oakeef/Word-Guess-Game)

For future revisions I think I would like to add an array of strings of words to guess and the game will randomly select one or have a user input for a friend to guess. Also a better GUI.
