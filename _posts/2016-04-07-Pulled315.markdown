I've been in to powerlifting for a little over a year now, on and off, and I absolutely love it. It's a great way to get stronger and feel good about yourself. It's also a great way to eat a lot and use that stored up energy for something.

One of my favorite lifts is the deadlift. It's the king of lifts because it activates pretty much every muscle in your body. The name is exaclty what it sounds like, you lift the weight from a dead stop. It starts on the ground on a barbell and you use your hips like a hinge and bring it up until you are standing up straight. I remember when I first pulled a 225lb deadlift, which is 2 x 45lb plates on either side of the bar, and it felt amazing. So my goal for the longest time was to be able to pull 315lbs, which is another 45lb plate on either side for a total of 3 plates on each side.

I finally hit my goal not just once but I was able to do it twice! Well, after I tried to load up another 10lbs on each side and fail that. I'm super proud of that and my next deadlift goal is 405lbs which is 4 plates on either side. I train about 3 times a week, usually monday/wednesday/friday, so I will try and keep updates on here mainly for myself to remember where I am and how far i've come.
