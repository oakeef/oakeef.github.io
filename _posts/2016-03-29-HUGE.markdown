A few of my friends and I record a podcast every week and release them every Monday.
I'ts called Hopped Up Gaming: East or HUGE for short. It's a podcast all about Beer and Video Games. We have been recording these for a couple years now and they are a blast!

I will be posting these every week for anyone checking out my site to enjoy.
Here is the latest episode! Feel free to check it out and tell me what you think.
