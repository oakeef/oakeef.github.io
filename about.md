This is my About page. My name is Evan and I am learning to be a software developer. Currently attending my second year at NSCC in Halifax enrolled in the General Programming stream. I have always had an interest in computers as long as I can remember. For the last 7 years I have been a computer technician, but looking for a change in career I decided to start learning the software side of things. Hoping to get a job as a Junior Developer to really dive in to the field and apply all of the skills I have learned along the way.

I have experience points in:

- Python
- Java
- C++
- Android Development
- PHP
- Wordpress
- Laravel
- Git

I will now list things of interest in no particular order:

1. Great hair
2. Powerlifter
3. Likes 80's cars
4. Is about 5'10" on the best of days
5. Has seen way too many movies and quotes them often
6. Makes terrible jokes
7. Doesn't like top 10 lists
