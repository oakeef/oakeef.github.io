This is my About page. So here is some stuff about me you may or may not know already.  
I have been a computer technician for over 7 years but I got bored and decided I wanted to learn how to code. I made a website called CompactGamer, a site all about small form factor gaming computers, but turns out I hate writing. Now i'm just trying to figure out how to make the next best fart app and become a godzillionaire.

I will list things of interest in no particular order:

1. Great hair
2. Powerlifter
3. Likes 80's cars
4. Is about 5'10" on the best of days
5. Has seen way too many movies and quotes them often
6. Makes terrible jokes
7. Doesn't like top 10 lists
