My name is Evan and I am a software developer. Currently attending my second year at NSCC in the general programming concentration. I am also learning at Treehouse on the side. You can check out my profile [here](https://teamtreehouse.com/oakeef). I love learning and am always excited to learn new things. I have always had an interest in computers and for the last 7 years I have been a computer technician, so learning the software side of things was the logical next step for me. I am currently looking for new and exciting oppourtunities as a developer. I am always interested in networking and meeting new people that can teach me something.
