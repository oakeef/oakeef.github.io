My name is Evan and I am a Web Developer. Currently working with a local firm called [Code and Mortar](https://codeandmortar.com/). I like building stuff and I am super interested in sorting data. I like to collect data and then try to find meaningful and interesting ways to sort it. I'm a big movie fan and I spend a lot of time watching movies. So much time in fact that I decided to make a review site just to keep track of the movies I watch and how I feel about them. You can check it out at [movies.stuffwithevan.com](http://movies.stuffwithevan.com/).

My other hobbies include looking for great deals on weird cars on autotrader, playing video games (poorly), talking about those video games on a weekly podcast called [Hopped Up Gaming East](https://www.hipcast.com/podcast/HJfyJb), and finally powerlifting.
