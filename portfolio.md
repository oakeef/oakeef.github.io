Here are a few of the things I have been working on:

- [Android Fragments Application](https://github.com/oakeef/Android-Fragments)
	This was my latest Android application project. It was designed to show off fragments and responsive design, there are 3 fragments and depending on the screen density of the device it shows either a list view for phones or a grid view for tablets. The app is a list of animals and when you pick one it shows the picture of the animal in a new fragment. This app was quite a learning experience for me and you can read about it [here]({% post_url 2016-11-29-Android-App-Disaster %})
- [My portfolio/blog site made with Jekyll](https://github.com/oakeef/oakeef.github.io)
	The current website you are on was created using Github Pages and Jekyll. Very simple to set up and play with. Originally wanted to make a Wordpress site but that seemed like a lot more than I needed for just a simple blog/portfolio site. A friend recommended Jekyll and after a few hours of research and playing around I was able to get this site up and running. It's a work in progress and will be constantly changing and updating as I learn more.
- [A Rational Number Calculator in C++](https://github.com/oakeef/rational-Calc)
	One of my favorite C++ projects I have worked on so far because I really like math. It takes in rational numbers and does various calculations on them. It was an exercise in creating class files and header files, creating custom constructors and overloading operators. I really enjoyed learning about overloading operators because up until this project I had no idea you could do that!
- [Android Rolling Calculator Application](https://github.com/oakeef/Android-RollingCalc)
	The Rolling Calculator app was the very first full Android app I had created. It didn't work out exactly how I wanted it but I am still proud of what I could accomplish. Rolling calculators are a bit different than regular ones so it took some research and a bit of trial and error to eventually get the right
- [Simple Role Playing Game in Java](https://github.com/oakeef/roleplaying-game)
	For one of my final projects of my first year Java class I had to make an simple RPG. The project was designed to show off all the skills we had learned up to that point in the class. It had to be object oriented and use a GUI. There is a hero character than can get money to buy new weapons, there are also a whole bunch of enemy characters (Dragon, Goblin, Spider, etc.) that have different types of attacks and stats. I had a ton of fun making this program because I love video games, especially RPGs. It may not be pretty and it may not be balanced but in my first year of school this was my best project.
